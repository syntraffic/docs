The status page is divided into three sections

**Calendar cells**: The left most section is the calendar cells which show the availability of the component. Here is what the calendar cells color indicate:

.. raw:: html

	<div style="width:24px;height:24px;border:1px solid #fff;background:#fff;">&nbsp;</div>: No issues have been detected for this day.
	<div style="width:24px;height:24px;border:1px solid #ccc;background:#ccc;">&nbsp;</div>: We have no data for this day. This can happen if monitoring of the target website was not started/paused and hence we have no data for this day.
	<div style="width:24px;height:24px;border:1px solid gray;background:gray;">&nbsp;</div>: This is a future day and hence we have no data for this day.
	<div style="width:24px;height:24px;border:2px solid #25a52e;background:#fff;">&nbsp;</div>: The green border indicates that this is the data for today.
